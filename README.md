## Usage
```
// Connect to MongoDB Service
$adapter_config = [];
$adapter_config['db_name'] ='db_name';
$adapter_config['connection_string']="mongodb://127.0.0.1";
$adapter_config['options'] =[];
$m=new Soupmix\Adapters\MongoDB($adapter_config);

// Connect to Elasticsearch Service
$adapter_config             = [];
$adapter_config['db_name']  = 'indexname';
$adapter_config['hosts']    = ["127.0.0.1:9200"];
$adapter_config['options']  = [];

$e=new Soupmix\Adapters\ElasticSearch($adapter_config);

foreach($docs as $doc){
	// insert user into database
	$mongo_user_id = $m->insert("users",$doc);
	$es_user_id = $e->insert("users",$doc);

}
// get user data using id
$es_user_data = $e->get('users', "AVPHZO1DY8UxeHDGBhPT");


$filter = ['age_gte'=>0];
// update users' data that has criteria encoded in $filter
$set = ['is_active'=>1,'is_deleted'=>0];

$e->update("users",$)

$filter = ["siblings.male.count__gte"=>2];

//delete users that has criteria encoded in $filter
$e->delete('users', $filter);



// user's age lower_than_and_equal to 34 or greater_than_and_equal 36 but not 38
$filter=[['age__lte'=>34,'age__gte'=>36],"age__not"=>38];

//find users that has criteria encoded in $filter
$docs = $e->find("users", $filter);
